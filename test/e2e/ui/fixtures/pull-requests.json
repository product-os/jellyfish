    "description": "Change-type: patch\r\nSigned-off-by: Josh Bowling <josh@balena.io>\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAdd a new `done` flag used to denote when a task is complete. This is much cleaner and easier to understand than the previous strategy of using a combination of `running`, `passed`, and `failed` flags. This seems to fix at least one of the bugs that would cause the process to exit with `0` before all tasks were actually complete.",
