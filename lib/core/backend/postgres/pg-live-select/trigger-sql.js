	 * This function chunks the "before" and "after" payload so that we
	 * can workaround the 8000 bytes NOTIFY limitation.
	 *
	 * This is conceptually straighforward, but the main problem is that
	 * the JSON objects we get may contain unicode characters, and
	 * therefore the character length may be smaller than the actual byte
	 * length, and we end up blowing up the size limitation if not careful.
	 *
	 * The algorithm is the following:
	 *
	 * - Convert the stringified JSON object into a byte array
	 * - Take out the amount of bytes that we know we can handle
	 * - Attempt to convert back that byte array into an UTF-8 string.
	 *   We might be cutting in the middle of a surrogate, so we need to
	 *   handle that, otherwise the conversion will fail
	 * - Use the UTF-8 substring to determine what is the amount of
	 *   logical characters we need to extract
