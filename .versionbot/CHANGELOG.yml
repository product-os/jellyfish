        This changes drops the previous approach of prefixing the path parm with
        the card type and now prefers card slugs over card ids.
        Prefixing by card type was an optimisation added to improve performance
        on rethinkdb, but now we use postgres there is no performance
        improvement and this oddity is not needed.

        This user is set as `INTEGRATION_DEFAULT_USER`, and will be used on an
        OAuth request if the current actor is not linked to the OAuth service
        but the default user is.
        Some of this workflow is unit tested, and we will increase the coverage
        after building the first OAuth integration.

        This is a hot fix. For some reason
        `sdk.card.get('84e2b286-fbc2-4ade-b093-dfdaa11a0ae6')` succeeds but
        `sdk.card.getWithTimeline('84e2b286-fbc2-4ade-b093-dfdaa11a0ae6')`
        returns `null`, causing an issue when dispatching the action right
        below (`SET ACTOR`).

        When syncing messages, we check that neither the database nor the
        sequence we are about to insert mention the mirror id we are dealing
        with.
        However consider that multiple workers might be trying to create the
        same message/whisper. Neither of them reference the mirror id in their
        sequences, and they check the database at the same time, so they might
        still insert the same thing twice. The slug is the only safe way to
        prevent this.

        Turns out the current approach is incredibly expensive on a real-world
        database with a lot of data. There are better ways to do it which we can

        I couldn't figure out why, but it seems that LogEntries is plainly
        swallowing any message with a "warn" or "error" level. After some
        experimentation, if we manually set levels to match syslog, I replaced
        "warn" with "warning", and "error" with "crit" (as "error" would still
        be ignored).

        I refactored the logger module to take a LogEntries token, and if that's
        available, it will send the logs directly to LogEntries (preserving
        object structure) and NOT output to `stdout`, which should also give us
        a small boost on production, as we don't have to stringify huge objects,
        etc.
        Everything behaves as usual if such token is not set.

        We added this as a way to prevent flaky tests. The retries were running
        in parallel on the workflow, but that means that if a job fails, we can
        "retry from failed", and avoid the sporadic issues altogether.
        By making them all run in one job, we can't really cheat, as all the
        retries need to pass in one go for the build to be green.

        This should be a good enough solution to prevent us from inserting flaky
        tests or flaky components that make the tests sporadically fail. It is
        more computational wasteful, but I think its a fair tradeoff given the
        amount of time we're spending dealing with sporadic CI failures (when
        debugging them or trying to merge something else).
        If it becomes a problem, then we can probably get more Circle CI
        parallel jobs in our plan.

        This change allows integration tests to run in parallel, speeding up
        test build times.
        The portFinder package is now used to find open ports for the web
        server, as the previous approach of waiting for an 'error' event to be
        emitted would fail due to the `--abort-on-uncaught-exception` flag.

        Wrapping the glob pattern in a string prevents the OS from expanding the
        arguments before passing to the underlying process and lets AVA handle
        the pattern matching directly. This is especially problematic as it
        stops deeply nested test files from running on CI servers.

        I found that in all cases where we're using these direct getters, we
        always know the type we are expecting in result. Therefore it makes
        sense to make it required, simplifying a lot of the logic to traverse
        through tables, and to make it very hard to introduce performance
        regressions that impact database reads.

        Fixes #672

        This change preserves the semantics of the original query, whilst

        restricting it using permissions and markers.

        Additionally, it ensures that "read" and "write" permissions for the
        same

        role are joined together with AND instead of OR.

        This asserts system can be used for cases that the server can recover
        from, but that shouldn't happen in the first place. The assertions will
        only run during testing/development and will NOT run in production.
        In this case, if two cards have the same ids or slugs, then the server
        will be fine with it by just returning the first one, while throwing
        would crash the whole system. We still want to catch these cases on our

        As of commit a591ce0b774bd21c4c7e3f92ceeaa71c45ea458e (v7.6.0), the
        randomstring module is used as a direct dependency, however it was still

        We have a mutable `matchCard` variable that is either a reference to the
        card on which we're processing triggered actions, or a deep clone of it
        with the `target` property expanded.
        Right below its declaration, we're processing triggered actions
        concurrently (with `Bluebird.map`), which means that there is a
        potential race condition where the `matchCard` variable will be
        re-mutated to its non-expanded case after a mutation caused by another
        trigger, and therefore a certain triggered action will not run.

        This allows line breaks to be added, but they're not rendered as
        expected, as the markdown renderer ignores the line break.

        I will need to follow up with a rendition version bump once

        Turns out `.filter()` can't use indexes, and thus getting an element by
        slug (a common pattern) on a big database is really, really expensive.
        This gives us a ~75% improvement as far as I could see on my system.

        Query schemas can declare a `$$links` keyword consisting of a key value
        pair of link type and link schema. We currently support two types of
        links:
        - `is attached to`: The target of a card
        - `has been attached to by`: The timeline of a card
        These work by inspecting the `data.target` property, but will be
        generalized in the future to work with separate link cards, and
        therefore support richer link types.
        The result of evaluating a link is stored in the cards' `links` top
        level property. If you want to see the link matches of your query, you
        can whitelist such property.

        When the server receives an action request through its HTTP API, it
        enqueues it and starts waiting for the result.
        The wait function algorithm looks like this:
        - Check if the request has been executed already, if so return it
        - Open a stream to wait for it
        The race condition can happen if the action request is executed after we
        checked if the request has been executed, but before we open the stream.
        In this case, the worker will just hang forever waiting for the result.

        Time triggered actions don't have an input card as there is no insertion
        (but time) that triggers them. We still want to be able to generate
        action requests out of those, so we must modify `triggers.getRequest()`
        to react to the fact that the input card is now optional.
        This basically means that the `source` property will not be accessible
        in time-based triggered action templates.

        This is a small PR to set things up for time-triggered actions. These
        type of triggered actions only differ in that they won't have a filter,
        so we must update the worker to only consider type triggers that do
        contain a filter (i.e. are based on insertion of other cards).

        ESLint by default forbids indentation of `case` and `default` blocks,
        which looks a bit weird. I found a way to tweak it with the `SwitchCase`
        option.

        If the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to production and a sentry
        DSN is provided, errors will be reported to sentry.
        The server and UI read the sentry DSN different environment variables,
        `SENTRY_DSN_SERVER` and `SENTRY_DSN_UI` respectively.
        The UI error reporting uses standard blanket reporting for any unhandled
        exception.
        The server must explicitly report exceptions using the new
        `error-reporter.js` module that exposes a `reportException` method.
        Presently only errors in the web server bootstrap are reported to
        sentry.

        Fixes #257
        Rather than loading the package.json into the UI, (which would be
        problematic in a closed-source repo) the version is exposed as
        a key/value pair on a new endpoint `/config`. In the future there may be
        more values we want to expose here.
