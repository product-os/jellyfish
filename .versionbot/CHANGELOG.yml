      hash: a04f3fa73a60dd9155f13a022ef6f55f860580c3
      body: >
        RUnning the check-filesnames.sh script on my macbook fails because of
        the following error:

        ```

        ❯ make lint FIX=1

        ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --ext .js,.jsx --fix scripts test

        ./scripts/lint/check-filenames.sh

        sed: 1: "s#^(|apps/ui/lib/layout ...": RE error: empty (sub)expression

        ```

        Specifically due to sed not being able to handle the empty
        (sub)expression. e.g. this fails:

        ```

        sed -E 's#^(|apps/ui/lib/layouts)##g'

        ```

        this succeeds:

        ```

        sed -E 's#^(apps/ui/lib/layouts)##g'

        ```

        the user menu!

    - subject: 'core: allow `$$links` to appear anywhere'
      hash: cce28c5488db84692f8cf61be79bb8e16c7e1233
      body: |
        Allowed enclosing keywords (recursively):
        - `$$links` (already allowed)
        - `allOf`
        - `anyOf`
        - `contains`
        - `items`
        - `not`
        - `properties`

        This works almost like any other keyword that you could put in the same
        place. That is, it constrains that specific schema. Inside `properties`
        for example:

        ```
        {
          properties: {
            name: {
              $$links {
                'is part of': {
                  properties: {
                    slug: {
                      const: 'org-balena'
                    }
                  }
                }
              },
              pattern: '^Balenista .*'
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        Cards returned through this query will meet the follwing two
        requirements at the same time:

        - If `name` exists, the card has an `is part of` link to another card
        that has the `org-balena` slug
        - If `name` exists, it must start with `Balenista `

        Note that if `name` does not exist, this query may return *any* `is part
        of` links.

        All type cards are initialized with a base UI schema.

      hash: 0cf207f79d4d8e300fa6736b8b4500932243ef81
      body: >
        We still use localForage as the storage engine. Persist and
        're-hydration' logic is now greatly simplified and handled automatically
        by the redux-persist config and the `persistStore` callback (
        `onHydrated`).


        The `setCoreState` action creator is no longer used/needed so it has
        been removed.


        The `PersistGate` component prevents the child components from rendering
        until the redux state has been re-hydrated. In practice this delay is so
        short as to be undetectable.


        Note - when this change is deployed, all users will have to login again
        as location of the cached session token will have changed.

      body: >
        This should fix the race condition seen where sometimes the first 'test'
        message in a thread is saved before the 'sync whisper' that is created
        by the asynchronous triggered action. This makes it hard to determine
        which event will be the 'last' in the list of events. Hopefully by
        waiting for the sync whisper before posting any test message to the
        thread, we ensure the sync message will always be the first one in the
        thread.

        New `Copy link to this message` context menu item. The event's ID is
        added to the URL as a query param.


        When the timeline is loaded, if there is an `event` query param in the
        URL, we scroll to that event. The focused event pulses the CSS outline
        property 3 times when it is displayed.

        The `newMessage` state is set on a 100ms debounced callback. If the user
        enters the 'Send Command' within 100ms of typing the last characters of
        their message, those characters were not getting sent. This change uses
        the current value of the DOM input element rather than the value cached
        in the `Timeline`'s state.

        - Moving header-related code into its own component (Header) - this
        could be broken-down further but I've left this for future work

        - Moving pending-message-related code into its own component
        (PendingMessages)

        - Moving userTyping code into its own component (TypingNotice)

        - Refactoring how we figure out which events to display. Previously we
        were looping through the list to remove the updates/create events and
        then doing another loop to check to see if the whisper should be
        removed. I've moved all the event code into a component called EventList
        which does one loop and makes decisions about how to render the card
        within that loop. It also compartmentalises this code into one place.
        I've added some tests to make sure this is correct.

        - Small fix to download thread to give it a sensible filename

      body: >
        Flattening out the redux state structure will make it much simpler to
        manage what parts of the state are persisted by redux-persist (using
        whitelist/blacklist).


        Note - this will cause some persisted state to be lost when this version
        is deployed, notably the current expanded items in the sidebar and
        whether the chat widget is open or not. But this is probably not worth
        creating a migration for!

        This change allows for triggered-actions to be evaluated and executed
        asynchronously, resulting in a big performance boost when processing
        actions. Triggered action cards default to being asynchronous.

    - subject: Remove "slices" definition from support issues
      hash: 0187244981245781fc6c0f3f22fa9f94dae73153
      body: |
        The current implementation of the "slices" functionality impedes the
        usefulness of the support issues, as it preselects high severity issues,
        which is not what is wanted by support agents. The "slices" concept most
        likely needs to be rethought, but for the time being, removing the
        annotation from the support issue card type will provide a good
        quality-of-life improvement for support agents looking through support
        issues.

      hash: e13cb85f39ba1ed07726a0e4ef0a31b72b28c3a6
      body: |
        The indexes are:

        - `data_cards_idx`: index on `cards.data`. Largest index by far but
          never actually used due to `jsonschema2sql` (both old and new) never
          actually generating queries in the right format to take advantage of
          it. The mechanism introduced in PR#3450 is a far superior mechanism
          anyway.
        - `idx_link_from`: index on `links.fromid`. Fully contained in the
          `idx_links_fromid_name` index and thus redundant.
        - `idx_link_to`: index on `links.toid`. Same thing as above except it's
          contained in `idx_links_toid_inversename`.

    - subject: Use raw discourse posts instead of the "cooked" HTML versions.
      hash: 57e62f867b44a4b5d81c2c08bdd1eeec78e9e845
      body: |
        Previously we were working with the HTML representations of messages
        from discourse, instead of the "raw" (usually markdown formatted)
        messages. This fixes an issue where after posting a message from
        Jellyfish, the message would be updated with the HTML representation
        generated by discourse. It also means that #summary detection should
        work correctly for message that originate in discourse.

      hash: cc879f4c5492be4c25a1ea07f328f08d261c05bf
      body: |
        The triggered action that re-opens a support thread when an issue it's
        attached to is closed has been changed so that it will only trigger when
        an update event that closes the issue is created.
        Previously the trigger would run on every worker job that matched the
        state where an issue and a support thread are linked and they are both
        closed. This had the side effect of triggering the action when you link
        to an issue that is already closed, or if you edit a field of a closed
        issue.

      hash: c21999195cf88fcbb314abfefa7d98fa7d499bed
      body: >
        Firefox does not work with a source svg file unless the width and height
        are specified. So we use separate png files of the correct sizes
        instead. We also now define multiple sizes of favicons (at the moment 16
        and 32). The font is also now a bit bolder so that it still renders well
        on Firefox on Windows.

      body: |
        RDS doesn't seem to fully support enabling the auto-scaling using
        CloudFormation but the storage size can be set there.

        This template also sets the database DeletionPolicy to 'Retain' to
        allow faster replacement in the future if needed.

        The template is already deployed into production.

    - subject: 'HOTFIX: Remove unnecessary html parsing function'
      hash: bebf42729a4a0deb3c01971cae8ee9e3ac53aa54
      body: |
        This function causes action workers to OOM when parsing deeply nested
        HTML. This function is actually unnecessary as the Markdown renderer in
        the UI can also safely display HTML strings.

        A follow up PR will be made to update the front and discourse test
        suites.

    - subject: 'Add support for skipping, limiting, and sorting linked cards in a query'
      hash: fc5f6183fea9ca39a957386200014c747977cf68
      body: |
        This commit adds support for an additional key `links` in the `options`
        argument for `Kernel.query()` and `jsonschema2sql`. `links` is a map
        from link type to an `options` object for that link type. For example,
        passing the following as `options`:

        ```
        {
          skip: 20,
          limit: 10,
          sortBy: 'updated_at',
          sortDir: 'desc',
          links: {
            'has attachment': {
                skip: 100,
                limit: 500,
                sortBy: 'created_at',
                sortDir: 'desc',
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        Root `skip`, `limit`, `sortBy`, and `sortDir` are the usual accepted
        keys for `options`, while the same keys inside `links['has attachment']`
        will only apply to the `has attachment` linked cards.

        This is implemented through windowing functions over a list of linked
        card IDs, so overhead should not be significant.

        Closes #3949

    - subject: Improve performance when keeping trigger data up to date in workers
      hash: 7280bf217f252235479b22a1f62158782d028183
      body: >
        Previously, when a triggered-action was upserted into the DB, every
        worker would

        load every triggered-action again. With this change, individual
        triggered-action

        are extracted from the stream event payload, and updated individually,

        allowing us to avoid querying the jellyfish core.

    - subject: Add GraphQL server with generated types.
      hash: 20405960eda2a179025d16a5fe3c4dd18c877a97
      body: >
        Includes:

        * Adds the `graphql.js` GraphQL server.

        * Adds schema generation based off our card data model.

        * Basic querying by ID and JSON-Schema filter.


        Doesn't include:

        * Correct resolution of all type fields.

        * Implementation of Relay conventions for list fields.

        * Query resolution of any but the root fields.


        This can be safely deployed because:

        1. It doesn't give access to any information you can't already access
        via the API (it maintains existing session-based security).

        2. No one knows it even exists.

        The standard card actions component now includes a video link that will
        open a Google Meet specific for that card in a new tab/window. If no
        link exists, one will be created, saved to the card's data and then the
        link opened.

      body: |
        Commit `1904f273900b8a19d8b073aa8a804828eeedcfb0` added an assertion to
        the new `jsonschema2sql` compiler that throws an error of type
        `JellyfishInvalidSchema`, passed through the `options` object. This
        commit adds a module-specific `InvalidSchema` error, applied to all
        applicable cases. This commit also removes the need for
        `options.errors` to simplify the logic and avoid cases where
        `options.errors` could be undefined.

        Generate better SQL in the new compiler with `required`/`properties` in
        schemas
      hash: af5d9343e103ffbf39c30e98368030d177785582
      body: |
        Some keywords (`type`, `const`, and `enum`) will only be true if the
        property they constrain exists, while all other keywords can be true if
        the property doesn't exist. We can use this to elide checks for required
        properties. For example:

        ```
        {
          properties: {
            'data': {
              required: ['actor'],
              properties: {
                actor: {
                  const: 'user-qwerty'
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        The `required: ['actor']` schema fragment would generate an SQL
        fragment (if querying the `cards` table):

        ```
        cards.data ? 'actor'
        ```

        In this case this check can be elided because `actor` is constrained by
        a `const` keyword. The following two fragments are functionally equal:

        ```
        cards.data ? 'actor'
        AND
        const.data->>'actor' = 'user-qwerty'
        ```

        ```
        const.data->>'actor' = 'user-qwerty'
        ```

        This optimization works recursively, so a deep `const` may cause
        multiple `required` to be elided.

        Note - the 'useDebounce' React hook has been extended to allow the
        caller to disable the lag/debounce for rising edges and/or falling edges
        - this applies more to boolean values but can still be used with, for
        example, string values where you want different behaviour when the
        string is empty.

        Due to a race condition, the number of channels can still be 1 at the
        point when HomeChannel is mounted even when other channels are being
        loaded. Therefore we need to rely on the location instead (which is
        simpler and should have been used in the first place!).

    - subject: Reduce emission of type-checking conditionals in the new compiler
      hash: 87c4067a8d91691fa0a66a096f7d7d6074283b4a
      body: |
        Many JSON schema keywords must be implemented with a material
        conditional at the SQL level, equivalent to:

        ```
        typeof <field> === <type> ? <condition> : true
        ```

        This is implemented as a boolean expression at the SQL level:

        ```
        NOT <isType> OR <condition>
        ```

        where `<isType>` is the equivalent SQL for the `typeof` check.
        Frequently the type is specified in the schema, leading to the following
        SQL expression:

        ```
        <isType> AND (NOT <isType> OR <condition>)
        ```

        which siplifies to just `<isType> AND <condition>`. PG does not
        recognize this optimization opportunity so this commit applies it at the
        compiler level.

      body: >
        Removed the deferred require statement in Segment component as we just
        import `full` before importing `User` in `User.spec.jsx`.

        `ui-setup.jsx` is picked up automatically by the ava test settings as
        it's a `.jsx` file so I've removed the explicit reference to it in
        `test/register.js`.

        Added logic to ensure addUser action still works as expected when
        failing to send the first time login link.

        The platform stability is now dramatically improved (We originally
        reduced e2e testing to improve velocity whilst we addressed the
        outages), so its time to turn the testing back on.

        This would clearly be a user error. We can throw a meaningful error such
        as `JellyfishInvalidSession` and don't report it to Sentry.

        This is a heuristic that will be replaced by using the loop card to

        to using loops in the future.

        Needed to be careful to avoid duplications when merging `required`
        fields - hence the use of `_.mergeWith` with a customizer function.
        Abstracting out the search filter to a single method will also prove
        useful when we start searching for `searchable` fields and the search
        filter has to be modified.

        Profiling showed that lodash's `defaults()` was taking a not
        insignificant amount of time. Benchmarking showed that using plain `in`
        operators to set the default values led to a not insignificant
        performance boost.

      hash: ff833a395f8ff4c706ac832d530403f92037ff5b
      body: |
        Turns out PG's default isolation level is `read commited` which allows
        nonrepeatable reads, possibly leading to spurious mismatches between old
        and new compilers. This commit explicitly uses `repeatable reads`
        isolation level to avoid that problem.

        Small change to the webpack config which ensures we don't inject the

        mode or we've explicitly said we're debugging the SW (via the
        JF_DEBUG_SW env var). This change speeds up the build time when
        debugging and also removes the 'InjectManifest has been called multiple
        times' warning when running `make dev-ui`.

      hash: 30959f278de7c02c62dfb74b12069eb0b3bbc2ed
      body: |
        Previously we were relying on the value to look like a string, which led
        to spurious quoting for variables that could have a number-like value
        like a port.

        Also templeting was used inconsistently by using double brackets
        ({{...}}) which HTML escapes instead of triple ones that put the value
        as-is.

        Both issued are fixed by universally quoting all values and converting
        everything to triple brackets.

        Added a manifest and a service worker. Jellyfish can now be 'installed'
        as a Progressive Web App. All static resources are pre-cached by the
        service worker using a 'CacheFirst' strategy. When the app is updated in
        any way, the user is notified via a confirm dialog and the app is
        updated and the page is refreshed once they accept.

    - subject: Add a reworked `jsonschema2sql` under a feature gate
      hash: 7b3c02725b4ebbd8449456f015ebe08ac8d5e96b
      body: |
        This rework is necessary to support further improvements, some of which
        are already incorporated in this commit such as:

        - A new query structure for linked cards relying on plain joins instead
          of subqueries. Benchmarks show that this new structure is consistently
          faster than the old query structure even on difficult edge cases;
        - Better error checking instead of silently ignoring wrong schemas;
        - Correct query generation for some nested keywords (i.e. nested
          `required` that is currently ignored);
        - Other minor improvements and handling of rare corner cases.

        This PR also prunes:

        - The experimental alternative query generator that supports `$$links`
          within `$$links`. This code path is unused in production and conflicts
          with this rewrite. If needed, this feature can be reintroduced in the
          future;
        - Support for setting `null` as the schema for a linked cards,
          signifying that the link must not exist. This functionality is not
          currently used and would be obsoleted anyway when support for nested
          links lands;
        - Support for the following keywords (may be readded later):
          - `default`
          - `patternProperties`
          - `propertyNames`
          - `formatMaximum`
          - `formatMinimum`

      hash: 7f81f558b1ecc592d52627e583d6a5db8958c3b5
      body: >
        Previously, the kernel tests would configure new backend and kernel

        instances for every test, allowing the tests to run in a pristine

        environment.

        This commit makes the bulk of the kernel tests share a backend and
        kernel

        instance, which required a number of refactors to ensure that the tests

        still work, even when there are many more cards in the system.

        Some tests have remained as they were, as they explicitly test

        disconnects, requiring them to have seperate instances.


        In addition to these changes, duplicate tests for skip and limit options

        have been removed.

        Based on the following resources:


        -
        https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2018-01-13-making-password-managers-play-ball-with-your-login-form

        -
        https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/form-styles-that-chromium-understands


        I formatted and tested our account management forms. With this change
        Jellyfish supports the following password managers:


        All routes:

        - Chrome

        - 1Password


        Route specific:

        - Firefox

        - LastPass


        1Password and Lastpass extensions work consistently on Safari, Chrome
        and Firefox.


        **Note:** Safari only triggers the keychain on actual page navigation.
        For now, the choice is made to not support Safari/iOS for this.


        Issue #1008 has been investigated and labeld won't fix

      hash: 142980bced111d00b3d5a1385acc4f7f7022ff99
      body: |
        Introducing a unique composite constraint on the slug and version
        properties for some reason slows down PostgreSQL a lot (>6x) when we
        have a lot of databases, which we do when running integration test (we
        create a separate database for each test case).

        This commit makes sure we drop the tables from the databases after
        running each integration test case, which seems to solve the issue.

        We will rely on the `INTEGER` counter-parts for better sorting
        performance. It will still look like a version string from outside, so
        we don't break any interface.

      body: |
        The Filters component was originally forked so that we could add queries
        on timeline messages. AFAIK this is a very little used feature, and we
        should include support for this in rendition instead of maintaining
        a seperate fork. Consider removing this forked component as a forcing
        function.

        Additionally requires the circleCI build job to pass before running
        other jobs

        This should help reduce resource usage on circle if a build were to fail
        early.

        Since the build job is cheap and efficient it's not a problem to run it
        before the other jobs.

      body: |
        This PR ensures the logic in "core" doesn't get confused by the addition
        of the new version columns, while still not making any use of them, so
        we can start rolling out the feature in a completely backwards
        compatible way.

    - subject: 'ui: Small improvements in card-linking UX'
      hash: 1c1230db7b7616f0cde697007b9d6371f4b03193
      body: >
        A collection of related improvements to the functionality of the core
        React components used for linking cards:

        - The CreateLens onDone callback now includes the created card as an
        argument

        - LinkModal now waits until the link is created before closing. The
        modal action button is disabled with a spinning cog icon during this
        time.

        - LinkModal now calls the 'onSaved' callback prop (if set) after
        creating the link.

        - Segment now combines existing links with 'draft' (unsaved) links
        (rather than operating with one or the other). 

        - Segment now calls the 'onCardsUpdated' callback prop (if set) whenever
        its list of cards is updated.

        - Segment always refreshes its data when a link is created via
        CreateLens or LinkModal. This means the list of cards in a Segment will
        always be updated after a link is added.

      hash: 6e0e9924cd77a68686c930be6449494b647af55c
      body: |
        Looks like `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `ALTER TABLE <XXX> ADD IF
        NOT EXISTS` will take exclusive locks on the table even if they are
        no-ops.

        After this commit, we approximate `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in a
        non-locking way by first fetching the list of existing tables. Of
        course, this is a non-atomic operation that will prevent the lock
        altogether in the best case, or will end up in the current no-op
        blocking situation in the worst case.

        I think its also safe to remove the `ALTER TABLE` statements below as
        all the environments we care about have been already migrated, and we
        need a better migration story anyways.

        Redux Dev Tools is a Chrome Extension that is very useful for debugging
        the Redux store. Its already supported by the main Jellyfish app. This
        commit adds the same change to the chat widget, explicitly providing a
        name for the chat-widget's Redux store so you can distinguish it from
        the 'Jellyfish' one in the main app.

      body: |
        We keep hitting weird cases where we try to insert a prospect into
        Outreach, Outreach complains that the email already belongs to another
        prospect, but then we query Outreach to find the prospect that has that
        e-mail and the result is none.

        Hopefully these extra logs will shed some light.

      hash: fcc849575c224ea41d6700a13cb6b4b488cca9dc
      body: |
        Consider that a user sends a post and then the user is hard deleted from
        the database as a response to that post (i.e. spam checks). The webhook
        event will contain no information about the actor whatsoever, all the
        details will be `null`, the API will respond with 404, etc.

        The orphaned post then belongs to the "system" Discourse user, which is
        the deletor of the post.

        This change will at least allow us to sync these deleted messages as
        belonging to the "system" user, rather than completely failing the
        action.

      hash: f3de9779f4441d9e80f7ddd21f22613a06fb9d1f
      body: |
        This indicates a transient issue on the external service that we are
        trying to integrate with, and retrying usually fixes the problem.

        We also improve the error messages a bit, so we display the base URL of
        the service that's actually failing.

        We are losing this already by moving (part of) the test suite to Balena
        CI (https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish/pull/3253), and not doing it
        anymore will likely make the tests run faster.

        This commit can always be reverted if we want to figure out how to get
        this back on Balena CI.

      body: |
        According to the docs, before/after hooks run all in parallel unless
        they are explicitly prefixed by "serial".

        Making them serial will help us debug cases like
        https://circleci.com/gh/product-os/jellyfish/74925, where before/after
        hooks blow up and we never get a stack trace as we don't enable
        `--fail-fast` in the CI.

    - subject: 'server: Increase ping timeout on web socket'
      hash: 638d4efe668c0960d19c2e4f5af8f19751a28fdf
      body: >
        If the web socket is being flooded with 'update' messages, it doesn't
        ping quickly enough. The socket times out and closes down. It may
        re-open but some streamed updates may not make it to the client (UI).
        This can cause e2e stress tests to fail.

        - Start the nsolid console: `nsolid-console`
        - Start the services you want with `NODE_ENV=nsolid`
        - Go to http://localhost:6753

      body: |
        For debugging and performance inspection purposes. The idea is that we
        can set `profile: true` on a particular query and get more detailed
        information, on the logs, about the time it took to resolve.

        Also 

        - Fix an eslint warning about React version not being specified

        - Add a note in the README about the dependency on `shellcheck`

        - Specify LF line endings in git attributes file. This is helpful for
        keeping things consistent when using Windows and WSL.

      body: |
        Consider running the thousands of test cases we generate on translate
        without using Ava's `--fail-fast` mode. If a test case fails, then its
        `afterEach()` won't be executed, which means that we would have a
        full-blown `lib/core` instance that is never uninitialised.

        Given the large amount of tests we generate, we may end up consuming all
        the available connections and make all the remaining tests fail:

        Before this change, every container depended on every file in the
        repository. We instead include only the files that we need in the
        container, which should help both circle and livepush caching, decrease
        the container size and make the project easier to reason about in
        general.

        `beforeEach`, `after`, and `afterEach`, without using namespaces such as
        `helpers.jellyfish`, `helpers.cache`, etc that make everything more
        confusing than it should be.

      body: |
        Looks like we were accidentally setting up a browser environment for all
        our tests, which meant that on server e2e tests, the SDK would use, on
        Node.js, `jsdom` instead of `http` to make HTTP calls, which could
        potentially be the root cause of some of the mysterious "Network Error"
        test flakiness on the e2e suites.

        There is a (tiny) chance that the stream resolves a wait match before

        (or while) we attempted to run `.getCardBySlug()`.


        We've seen this happening on Circle CI, where the race condition showed

        itself as:


        ```
          ✔ events › .wait() should ignore cards that do not match the id (521ms)
        Uncaught AbortError: EXEC can't be processed. The connection is already
        closed.


        FROM
          ✖ test/integration/queue/events.spec.js exited due to SIGILL
        ```

    - subject: 'front: Correctly throw error object from request-promise'
      hash: d7cf1809609cd593efe1d2b288b33336f91f8c8c
      body: |
        According to the docs at https://github.com/request/request-promise, the
        error object that the promise rejects with looks like this:

        ```
        cause: err,
        error: err,
        options: options,
        response: response
        ```

        And apparently the actual error can be either on `cause` or on `error`,
        but its unclear why they have such distinction or on what cases
        `error.error` is a string.

        We should probably refactor this to not use `request-promise`, but then
        we're ditching Front anyways, so it might not be worth the effort.

        We log the warning in the conditional, but we let it through anyways,
        which causes `errio` to then throw in a more obscure way.

        Returning with an error earlier in this case will unclutter Sentry and
        the logs.

        Be quick at querying cards The previous approach was `join` based and
        queries were taking a long time to run. This new approach split that
        query in 3 parts: 1 main cards, 2 cards that link to the main cards, 3
        cards the main cards link to. In essence, some of the work previously
        done by the db is now done by the server, including some filtering and
        some sorting. On the plus side, we can now express queries with multiple
        links, eg: give me cards of type X, that have links of type Y and no
        links of type Z. Unfortunately, this approach is not 100% backwards
        compatible, due to the way we traverse our graph: we need to rewrite
        some queries in order to make them "graph friendly". This needs time and
        experimentation, so the query is hidden behind a feature flag that UI
        can trigger via `options.experimental` set to any truthy value. Tests
        can be run from the command line with the env var
        FEATURE_FLAG_EXPERIMENTAL set to 1: this will make all queries use the
        new approach

      body: |
        Enabling the priority buffer on a queue instance means that the queue
        also opens a stream for action requests and attempts to consume from
        there before finding the action request on the requests table, as an
        optimisation.

        We don't need this optimisation on the tick's queue, as we don't consume
        incoming action requests like the other types of action servers.

        Most of these test changes are caused by the fact that we are replacing
        a custom "merge" logic set of statements with the more proper
        `skhema.merge()` function, which highlighted some semantic issues.

        As far as I can tell, these changes to how we use `additionalProperties`
        are correct, while the previous ones were ambiguous in some cases.

    - subject: 'docker-compose: Setup 3 worker replicas'
      hash: 1cb8fed82249eb4ae8af3e4d1249ad0e267f3c4e
      body: |
        We have to copy paste the component definition as Balena's Docker
        Compose implementation doesn't support the `replicas` keyword.

        This change should hopefully speed up the e2e tests.

      body: |
        Consider a piece of code that checks whether a card exists in order to
        call the `.insertCard()` or `.patchCard()` worker method. If the outcome
        is to insert, but the card gets inserted in the mean-time, then by the
        time the executor runs, it will check again in order to decide if it
        should post a `create` or an `update` event, which means we can end up
        with a `create` event that has the payload of an `update` event.

      hash: 9d70481287d760261ffc026053c721cc6830e581
      body: |
        We've seen in the wild a post destroy event without a `user_id`
        property, but with a `username` instead.

        This could be because of a recent Discourse change.

        Will help for debugging purposes. We have a case where `userId` is
        `undefined`, but its proving hard to track down without more info. We'll
        know more next time.

        - The `test-ui` command is the only test command that doesn't follow our
        `test-<type>-<component>`, making it tricky to document, as it needs to
        be an exception to our convention

        The `../../` things are a bit weird, but we probably need to figure that
        out for other modules anyways.

      body: |
        The benefits are:

        - A lot less code, as RabbitMQ supports the exact same way our queue
        works like
        - A decent speed boost
        - A lot less queries against PostgreSQL, allowing us to have much more
        workers with little overhead

        The benefits are:

        - A lot less code, as RabbitMQ supports the exact same way our queue
        works like
        - A decent speed boost
        - A lot less queries against PostgreSQL, allowing us to have much more
        workers with little overhead

        Enough to keep track of references to Outreach sequences and be able to
        trigger them from Jellyfish. We will create more involved scenarios as
        we need them.

                Debian Buster now uses Avahi 0.7 instead of
                0.6.32. This means that there is now a stricter
                policy defining MDNS domains. This commit allows
                us to use multipart subdomains.

        This changes drops the previous approach of prefixing the path parm with
        the card type and now prefers card slugs over card ids.
        Prefixing by card type was an optimisation added to improve performance
        on rethinkdb, but now we use postgres there is no performance
        improvement and this oddity is not needed.

        This user is set as `INTEGRATION_DEFAULT_USER`, and will be used on an
        OAuth request if the current actor is not linked to the OAuth service
        but the default user is.
        Some of this workflow is unit tested, and we will increase the coverage
        after building the first OAuth integration.

        When syncing messages, we check that neither the database nor the
        sequence we are about to insert mention the mirror id we are dealing
        with.
        However consider that multiple workers might be trying to create the
        same message/whisper. Neither of them reference the mirror id in their
        sequences, and they check the database at the same time, so they might
        still insert the same thing twice. The slug is the only safe way to
        prevent this.

        Turns out the current approach is incredibly expensive on a real-world
        database with a lot of data. There are better ways to do it which we can
        explore in the future, but for now we can give up on it (we only use it
        for runtime metrics purposes) so the application is at least not down.

        I couldn't figure out why, but it seems that LogEntries is plainly
        swallowing any message with a "warn" or "error" level. After some
        experimentation, if we manually set levels to match syslog, I replaced
        "warn" with "warning", and "error" with "crit" (as "error" would still
        be ignored).

        We create the indexes sequentially, which makes the `Backend#connect()`
        method take up to 5 seconds to complete, which makes unit tests pretty
        slow. Doing them in parallel cuts the time in half.

        I refactored the logger module to take a LogEntries token, and if that's
        available, it will send the logs directly to LogEntries (preserving
        object structure) and NOT output to `stdout`, which should also give us
        a small boost on production, as we don't have to stringify huge objects,
        etc.
        Everything behaves as usual if such token is not set.

        We added this as a way to prevent flaky tests. The retries were running
        in parallel on the workflow, but that means that if a job fails, we can
        "retry from failed", and avoid the sporadic issues altogether.
        By making them all run in one job, we can't really cheat, as all the
        retries need to pass in one go for the build to be green.

        This should be a good enough solution to prevent us from inserting flaky
        tests or flaky components that make the tests sporadically fail. It is
        more computational wasteful, but I think its a fair tradeoff given the
        amount of time we're spending dealing with sporadic CI failures (when
        debugging them or trying to merge something else).
        If it becomes a problem, then we can probably get more Circle CI
        parallel jobs in our plan.

        This change allows integration tests to run in parallel, speeding up
        test build times.
        The portFinder package is now used to find open ports for the web
        server, as the previous approach of waiting for an 'error' event to be
        emitted would fail due to the `--abort-on-uncaught-exception` flag.

        Wrapping the glob pattern in a string prevents the OS from expanding the
        arguments before passing to the underlying process and lets AVA handle
        the pattern matching directly. This is especially problematic as it
        stops deeply nested test files from running on CI servers.

        I found that in all cases where we're using these direct getters, we
        always know the type we are expecting in result. Therefore it makes
        sense to make it required, simplifying a lot of the logic to traverse
        through tables, and to make it very hard to introduce performance
        regressions that impact database reads.

        Fixes #672

        This change preserves the semantics of the original query, whilst

        restricting it using permissions and markers.

        Additionally, it ensures that "read" and "write" permissions for the
        same

        role are joined together with AND instead of OR.

        This asserts system can be used for cases that the server can recover
        from, but that shouldn't happen in the first place. The assertions will
        only run during testing/development and will NOT run in production.
        In this case, if two cards have the same ids or slugs, then the server
        will be fine with it by just returning the first one, while throwing
        would crash the whole system. We still want to catch these cases on our
        test runs.

        As of commit a591ce0b774bd21c4c7e3f92ceeaa71c45ea458e (v7.6.0), the
        randomstring module is used as a direct dependency, however it was still
        listed as a dev-dependency, causing the app to crash when running in
        production.

        We have a mutable `matchCard` variable that is either a reference to the
        card on which we're processing triggered actions, or a deep clone of it
        with the `target` property expanded.
        Right below its declaration, we're processing triggered actions
        concurrently (with `Bluebird.map`), which means that there is a
        potential race condition where the `matchCard` variable will be
        re-mutated to its non-expanded case after a mutation caused by another
        trigger, and therefore a certain triggered action will not run.

        This allows line breaks to be added, but they're not rendered as
        expected, as the markdown renderer ignores the line break.

        I will need to follow up with a rendition version bump once

        Query schemas can declare a `$$links` keyword consisting of a key value
        pair of link type and link schema. We currently support two types of
        links:
        - `is attached to`: The target of a card
        - `has been attached to by`: The timeline of a card
        These work by inspecting the `data.target` property, but will be
        generalized in the future to work with separate link cards, and
        therefore support richer link types.
        The result of evaluating a link is stored in the cards' `links` top
        level property. If you want to see the link matches of your query, you
        can whitelist such property.

        When the server receives an action request through its HTTP API, it
        enqueues it and starts waiting for the result.
        The wait function algorithm looks like this:
        - Check if the request has been executed already, if so return it
        - Open a stream to wait for it
        The race condition can happen if the action request is executed after we
        checked if the request has been executed, but before we open the stream.
        In this case, the worker will just hang forever waiting for the result.

        Time triggered actions don't have an input card as there is no insertion
        (but time) that triggers them. We still want to be able to generate
        action requests out of those, so we must modify `triggers.getRequest()`
        to react to the fact that the input card is now optional.
        This basically means that the `source` property will not be accessible
        in time-based triggered action templates.

        change, which is a line break in the initiation rituals text.
        Set eslint to ignore `*/dist/` folders rather than `sdk/*`, so that it
        is more compatible with the existence of other typescript modules and
        so that non-built js within `/sdk` is linted.

        If the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to production and a sentry
        DSN is provided, errors will be reported to sentry.
        The server and UI read the sentry DSN different environment variables,
        `SENTRY_DSN_SERVER` and `SENTRY_DSN_UI` respectively.
        The UI error reporting uses standard blanket reporting for any unhandled
        exception.
        The server must explicitly report exceptions using the new
        `error-reporter.js` module that exposes a `reportException` method.
        Presently only errors in the web server bootstrap are reported to
        sentry.

        Rather than loading the package.json into the UI, (which would be
        problematic in a closed-source repo) the version is exposed as
        a key/value pair on a new endpoint `/config`. In the future there may be
        more values we want to expose here.
